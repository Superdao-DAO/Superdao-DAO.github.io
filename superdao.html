Superdao  is a collection of various entities,individuals and autonomous agents c0orperating virtually without any geographical limitations to achieve a common goal and enabled by open source, democratic software, built on Ethereum blockchain.<br><br> For this specific implementation, the goal is to create decentralized disruptive products and service alternatives, targeted at high value industries, while providing the highest value possible to the end users of such services.</p>

At the center of the onion model is the onsititutionalDNA which carries the mission,  vision and contractual values of the Decentralized Autonomous  Organization; providing a system of checks and balances wrapped up in a  simple modular hub contract called consensusX.</p>

                      <p style="text-align:center;">Membership  is either determined by the "Merits", reputation earned from impactful  contributions to SuperDAO or by the possesion of function specific  membership tokens.<br> Tiered consensus participation is not mutually exclusive (i.e Merit earners can own and vote with tokens). Voting outcomes are based on weighted reputation or token number weight.<br>  The latter reigns soveregin over the general direction of  the organization. While, the former plays a role in the  efficient  management of the products and services of the DAO,  effectively merging the benefits of the efficiency of hierarchical  legacy organizations, with the innovative and intelligent swarmimg  bahavior of  the crowd.<br>Superdao's  software is also a factory for other organizations to leverage our system for their own benefit. Superdao is a viable solution for  bootstrapping efficient DAO Organizations. It also has state; meaning it can accomodate a single visionary working alone initially, then progressively boostrapping an organization to thousands of members in stages.<br> The incentives for membership growth are valuable token rewards in exchange for impactful contribution to the organization's components through a claimable token bounty process.</p>

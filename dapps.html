It is currently undergoing public user experience feedback testing before we complete the rest of the technological integration ready for mainstream launch.

                      <p>Pokereum poker (formally known as nxtpoker ) is the first decentralized poker project, that uses an EVM based smart contract, decentralized<br> blockchain and real time communication (RTC) peer to peer framework to solve the mental poker problem.<br>The solution to the mental poker problem leveraging smart contracts and RTC had been documented in a published draft paper prior (2014) to the completion of the platform (Ethereum blockchain) on which it is built .<br>Pokereum facilitateS poker games in a global & decentralized fashion allowing users to initiate and broadcast games to other potential players all over the world. A demo of the UX and proof of concept of peer to peer game state synchronization can be found <a href="http://demo.pokereum.io/"> here</a>.<br>The proof of concept to the mental poker component is <a href="https://github.com/Pokereum/pokereum/wiki/Whitepaper"> coming soon</a>. The client is made possible by the use of Ethereum smart contracts and telehash framework. The last component "Whisper" which is a redundant DHT network based messaging system is still in development and would allow for the global and reliable poker game listings and advertising. It is expectant that a fully implemented <br>working Beta client should be available and completed by the very early months of 2017. </p>

                          contributing to the goals of the DAO and or its components.<br>
                        Contributions must be impactful, valuable and  acceptable to the overall Superdao framework, dapps or the primary DAPP  (Pokereum Poker) it maintains.<br> The  claim system works on a review-approval system basis, in which anyone  with a prior approved contribution history in exchange for more tokens, can review new claims for new rewards, before such a claim is finally  approved or rejected by a more established members or commitee of the  DAO with similar experience in the area (minicom).<br> Bounty claims for tokens can be in any category including marketing, community contribution, organization and actual code contributions.
                        A percentage of the budget allocation of all tokens are awarded to short term bounty hunters. See more <a href="#">here</a><br> The  claim system enables self evaluation in the hopes that close to or honest self evaluations gain 20% extra tokens for the claimant, while dishonest claimants are penalized by a 40% deduction or even outright  denial of claim along with the reviewer.<br> The claim system uses multiple categories, sub categories, types and subtypes filtering to award points, see more <a href="http://docs.superdao.io">here</a>.

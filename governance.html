                       a  multi-tiered/layered abstraction set that enables interaction and a system of checks and balances from one layer to another.<br>
                       At the core of this model is the constitutionalDNA which allows for a definition of mission, vision and contractual values of SuperDAO. <br>
                       These definitions can be referenced within the DAO during an organizational proceeding to enforce rules and deter harmful behavior
                        not conducive to the purpose of the DAO. A multi-heuristic voting process usually follows to finalize  such proceedings.</p>

This layer allows fast and efficient decision making in the internals of the DAO using Merit based reputational voting.<br> Subdivided into "minicoms" or  sub committees that specialize in domain specific decision making. These  could represent Dapp teams, financial analyst, human resources and so  forth. Disputes arising from Minicom consensus are usually finalized by the larger Supercom consensus. Minicoms also provide  Supercoms or token holders with critical informed voting insights  garnered from  their collective domain specialization.<br> Contributions at the "Merit"  layer can be "structured contributions" according to the predefined team member limits and timely compensation. Contributions can also be  arbitrary (bounty hunters) working on pre-approved tasks of high impact  to SuperDAO's short term or long term goals.</p>

                      <p style="text-align: center;">The last Layer is the sovereign token Layer.<br> This is a slow moving  consensus layer that has absolute power over any decision as long as its proposals are not anti-missionary to SuperDAO. This layer utilizes a  pecialized dynamic quorum that is incentivized by value emitted in the DAO. <br> Primarily Tokens (Superneums) are the ultimate form of membership, they provide proof of membership to the DAO. Superneum tokens also serve as proof of participation indicators, requiring  active participation in the some of the DAO activities to extract any value from the the DAO. Some of the activities requiring active participation include; check and balance processes, dispute resolution within Supercoms and Minicoms, bounties reallocations and general assessment. A minimum criteria for participation is established before hand for the right to be able to claim excess reward value from dapp product and service pools.

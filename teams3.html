Hello! I started learning programming when I was 12 and started writing code beyond tutorials when I was 15. Haven't stopped programming ever since (27 now). First I learned C++ and VB6, but I saw no real way to create something, which can be useful right away, which got my eyes on web programming (LAMP stack). It was fascinating for me that you can create something, post it online and it becomes accessible in the whole Internet! I created a web site, got running a forum, a torrent tracker (wasn't illegal back then) and got myself a job as a freelancer for several months. Skipped university and after high school started working as a web programmer. Have been a freelancer for a year. I love programming!
